# CXA_I-Only-Take

## Summary
This solution is for challenge statement **“Hot Desking” for a SMART office** [Click here for the list of challenge statements from this hackathon](https://portal.imda.gov.sg/~/media/ITSC/Files/CXA%202017%20Challenge%20Statements.pdf)

IOT component is built into the table, will detect if there is someone using the facility. If so, it will update the mobile app to reflect that the seat is taken.

Mobile application will show the seating available that the user can sit at.

Booking System available on the mobile app 


## IOT Components
* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
* [Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2427)
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

## Software
* Android Studio
* FireBase

## Language Used
* Python

## Further Improvements

Can be paired with a TV screen at the lobby running the software to show the users where are the available seats when the first walk into the office.

Use a cheaper board, such as [Node MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) which can help to reduce cost of the solution.
